Hi! I am __David Dale__, research engineer in natural language processing. ðŸ‘‹

You can read more about me in [Russian](https://daviddale.ru/ru) or [English](https://daviddale.ru/en).

I am open to collaboration, especially on creating NLP tools (such as machine translation models) for lower-resourced languages.

Some of my best repos are:

* [dialogic](https://github.com/avidale/dialogic) - for developing multiplatform chatbots and voice skills in Python
* [compress-fasttext](https://github.com/avidale/compress-fasttext) - for bringing lightweight, fast and accurate word embeddings to your project
* [python-ruwordnet](https://github.com/avidale/python-ruwordnet) - for those who want to understand language beyound embeddings and need a Russian thesaurus
* [dependency-paraphraser](https://github.com/avidale/dependency-paraphraser) - a simple tool for paraphrasing that respect sentence structure
* [word-mover-grammar](https://github.com/avidale/word-mover-grammar) - a constituency grammar parser that supports word embeddings
* [weirdMath](https://github.com/avidale/weirdMath) - a collection of small Python etudes, mostly about data science

You can also take a look at [my HugginFace contributions](https://huggingface.co/cointegrated), including: 
* a [tiny Russian BERT](https://huggingface.co/cointegrated/rubert-tiny2)
* the first public [Russian NLI model](https://huggingface.co/cointegrated/rubert-base-cased-nli-threeway)
* the only [Russian multitask T5 model](https://huggingface.co/cointegrated/rut5-base-multitask)
* one of the largest Russian [paraphrase datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cointegrated/ru-paraphrase-NMT-Leipzig)
